# PSPMO Members Only - WordPress Plugin

The information in this document contains build information about the WP plugin.

## Production Build for a specific WP route.
Run the following to make a build if the route location is /members/

```ng build wordpress --prod```

This is a NG build command I need to get working at some point.

```ng build wordpress --prod --base-href /members/```
